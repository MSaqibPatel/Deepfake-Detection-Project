🎭 Deepfake Detection System

🔍 AI-powered tool to detect deepfake images and videos using Machine learning techniques.

Deepfake technology utilizes AI to manipulate media, creating highly realistic yet fake images, videos, and audio. While this technology has potential for creative applications, it also poses serious risks, such as misinformation and identity fraud. This project focuses on developing a Deepfake Detection System that identifies and flags deepfake media using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
